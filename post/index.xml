      <description>This was a personal project where I used Python to build a price scraper. The two hottest commodities right now are Stanley Cups and Cryptocurrencies. There are two parts to this project. First, I worked on using BeautifulSoup to scrape the prices of Stanley Cups on Amazon. It will check the price every five seconds. The output is put into a csv file. This entire process automated. For the cryptocurrencies, I used the CoinMarketCap API to pull in the data. Same as the Stanley's, the information is turned into a csv. For this part of the project, I made a visual using Tableau.</description>

The yahoo fin package help solves that huddle as it allow to automate the process through a script written in python.</description>

      <description>This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.
The main reason behind carrying out this research was to understand how big tech companies recommend items to its users, companies like Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and many more use recommendation systems to recommend items to its users on a daily basis.
Overview Recommendation system work on the principal of &amp;ldquo;homophily&amp;rdquo; which means similar users prefer similar items, this means that companies are able to accurately predict which users is most likely to buy something / watch something.</description>
